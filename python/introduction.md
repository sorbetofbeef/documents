# PYTHON COURSE - UDEMY

Introduction
------------

We're going to be making a MUDD game with python. It should incorporate everything needed to learn python at an introductory level. Huzzah!

Trevor (the instructor) will be using PyCharm as his IDE

Resources
---------
- https://python.org/3/ The official documentation. Assumes a pre-existing knowledge 
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/ Great resource for those with or without experience
- https://pypi.org Python package index. Database of python packages that can be downloaded and installed with pip3
  - make sure to check the update timestamps on packages

Compiled or Interpreted?
------------------------
- Go is an example of an interpreted language
  - this type has a compiler, which translates the go code into a binary file compromised of machine code
  - once compiled, the end-user needs to execute the file, and it runs
- Basic is an example of an interpreted language
  - it needs an interpreter installed on the user's machine
- Python is a bit of a hybrid language
  - it gets compiled to byte code which makes python more performant 
  - however, that byte code still needs the end-user to have installed the python interpreter for the program to run 
  - with third-party tools, python will compile into a single binary
- Compiled languages are faster than their two counterparts
